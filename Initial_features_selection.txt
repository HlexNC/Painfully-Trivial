Target variable: arrival_delay_m
Features to be removed: 
departure_delay_check and arrival_delay_check: high imbalance (roughly 69.8%) and not crucial to the model, delays can be detected from other features like arrival_delay_m.

departure_delay_m: highly correlated with arrival_delay_m and may affect the prediction results negatively.

info: 68.7% missing values, reasons for delay doesn't affect the prediction itself.

Path, eva_nr, station, state, city, long, lat, ID: We can represent the station only by the zip.

We will then later see if other features needs to be removed by practicing feature selection algorithms and checking leakages after training the first model. 
The list would be: (zip, category, arrival_plan, departure_plan, arrival_change, departure_change, arrival_delay_m)
