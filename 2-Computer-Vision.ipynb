    "### **Overview**\n",
    "The Deggendorf Waste Sorting Assistant is a Computer Vision-based tool designed to help residents and international students correctly identify waste bins. The project leverages image classification to determine the category of a given waste bin based on its visual characteristics. Users can take a picture of an unlabeled bin, and the model will classify it while providing information on the appropriate waste materials for disposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Goals**\n",
    "- Develop an image classification model capable of identifying waste bins in Deggendorf.\n",
    "- Provide users with clear guidance on proper waste disposal based on bin classification.\n",
    "- Document all processes in a Jupyter Notebook, covering dataset creation, model training, evaluation, and deployment.\n"

    "### **Dataset Creation**\n",
    "- Collect and photograph waste bins from different locations in Deggendorf, including Restm√ºll, Bioabfall, Gelber Sack, and Papier.\n",
    "- Label images according to the waste bin category and permissible waste items.\n",
    "- Preprocess images by applying normalization, augmentation, and resizing techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Training**\n",
    "- Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for waste bin classification.\n",
    "- Train the model using the labeled dataset.\n",
    "- Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Technologies Used**\n",
    "- **Python** for implementation.\n",
    "- **OpenCV** for image processing.\n",
    "- **TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch** for model development.\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive documentation."

    "### **Expected Outcome**\n",
    "- A trained image classification model for waste bin recognition.\n",
    "- A fully documented Jupyter Notebook covering all project aspects.\n",
    "- A functional prototype that can classify waste bins and provide disposal instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Future Enhancements**\n",
    "- Expansion to other cities with diverse waste bin colors and categories.\n",
    "- Real-time bin identification through video streams.\n",
    "- Multilingual support for a broader audience.\n",
    "- GPS-based recommendations for nearby waste disposal sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project contributes to sustainability efforts by promoting proper recycling practices and reducing waste contamination through an easy-to-use, technology-driven solution.\n"
