    "### **Overview**\n",
    "The Deggendorf Waste Sorting Assistant is a Computer Vision-based tool designed to help residents and international students correctly identify waste bins. The project leverages image classification to determine the category of a given waste bin based on its visual characteristics. Users can take a picture of an unlabeled bin, and the model will classify it while providing information on the appropriate waste materials for disposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Goals**\n",
    "- Develop an image classification model capable of identifying waste bins in Deggendorf.\n",
    "- Provide users with clear guidance on proper waste disposal based on bin classification.\n",
    "- Document all processes in a Jupyter Notebook, covering dataset creation, model training, evaluation, and deployment.\n"
